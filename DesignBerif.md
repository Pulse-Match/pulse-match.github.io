Design Brief: Brand Identity for Glid

Brand Name: Glid (Concept: Frictionless movement. Sliding into a game. Smooth connectivity.)

Brand Essence: "Kinetic Humanism" Technology shouldn't look like a computer terminal; it should feel like a sunny day at the park. We are the bridge between the digital phone and the physical field.

1. Logo & Symbolism

    The Mark: A lowercase, geometric "g". It should feel aerodynamic, resembling a running track loop or a path.

    Style: Flat, bold, and distinct. No complex gradients or 3D effects.

    Usage: The logo should stand freely (floating) rather than being trapped inside a circle or square container, symbolizing openness and freedom of movement.

2. Color Palette: "Sand & Field" A "Light Mode" first identity that moves away from the "Dark Mode/Cyberpunk" tech cliché. It feels organic, premium, and energetic.

    Primary Base (The Sand): Cream / Amber-50 (#FFFBEB).

        Usage: The main app background. It reduces eye strain and feels warmer than clinical white.

    Brand Primary (The Field): Emerald Green (#059669).

        Usage: The primary logo, main "Call to Action" buttons, and active icons. It represents the turf/grass.

    Brand Accent (The Clay): Burnt Orange (#EA580C).

        Usage: Notification dots, "Urgent" tags, or high-energy interactions. It represents the clay court or the sun.

    Typography/Ink (The Earth): Dark Stone (#1C1917).

        Usage: All primary text. Never use pure black (#000000); it looks too digital. Stone feels natural.

3. Typography

    Font Family: Outfit (Google Fonts).

    Characteristics: Geometric sans-serif. It has a high x-height (readable) and slightly rounded corners which makes it look friendly and sporty, but technical enough to be trustworthy.

    Hierarchy:

        Headlines: Bold (700) or ExtraBold (800). Tight tracking (letter-spacing) for a modern look.

        Body: Regular (400) or Medium (500). Relaxed spacing for readability.

4. Visual Style & UI Language

    Shape Language: "The Stadium Shape." Use deep rounded corners (Pill shapes) for buttons and cards (radius: 16px to 24px). Avoid sharp 90-degree angles.

    Layering: Use Pure White (#FFFFFF) cards on top of the Cream (#FFFBEB) background. This creates a subtle, physical depth (like a card sitting on a table) without needing heavy drop shadows.

    Photography: Candid, motion-blurred, and authentic. Avoid staged "stock photo" athletes smiling at the camera. Focus on the action (a shoe hitting the pavement, a racket swinging, a hand high-five).

5. Tone of Voice

    Tagline: "Stop Planning. Just Play."

    Personality: The "Supportive Coach."

        Do: Be direct, encouraging, and active. Use verbs (Find, Play, Connect, Go).

        Don't: Use academic or technical jargon ("Environmental intelligence," "Algorithm").

    Vibe: We are not a utility app; we are a lifestyle enabler. We don't just find you a slot; we get you back to the sport you love.

6. Target Audience

    The Everyday Athlete: Ages 20–40. They played sports in high school/college and miss the camaraderie.

    The Problem: They have the desire to play but hate the logistics (texting 10 people to find one opponent).

    The Emotional Hook: Glid removes the awkwardness of asking strangers to play. It turns a lonely Saturday into a match day.
